# Getting Started 

### In the terminal do: 
cd my-app  
npm install

### You can then run the project with the command
npm start

### Items to be aware of
Make sure to create a file named secrets.js within the src folder. Within this file you will need to fill in you API key details. Pleas refer to the section [Signing Up for you API](https://cms.codeinstitute.net/container/block-v1:CodeInstitute+RE101+2021_T1+type@vertical+block@714e9851637e4b7b9cc270394814e1f6)  

Inside the folder named src you will find a file named posts.json. This file will not be used until a challenge later in the content and will not appear in the file structure of the source code until that point  

For convenience react comes installed in this template. A package named axios has also been installed as it will be required in a challenge later.
